## Idea 1

My idea is to assess how female lead actors in movies impact viewership. I found a dataset that has columns for the female representation of the cast and the crew. I can use the female representation of the cast to fit a model to predict the popularity of the movie. Then I can use the female representation of the crew to do the same. I can use both variables to predict the outcome variable (popularity). This might help me answer my potential research question: How does female representation in the movie-making process impact the popularity of films?

Here's a potential dataset that I could use.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
movies <- read_csv("/Users/devica/Desktop/movies.csv")
glimpse(movies)
```
